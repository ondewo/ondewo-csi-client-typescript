# Release History

*****************

## Release ONDEWO CSI Typescript Client 5.5.2

### Bug Fixes

* **Release integrity: 5.5.1 published the Keycloak refresh fix to npm but its git tag did not
  contain it.** `make build` copies `auth/` into the published package, so the artifact carried the
  fix, while the release target's `git add` list named `api`, `Makefile`, `src`, `RELEASE.md`, the
  two package manifests and the submodules -- and not `auth/`. Building 5.5.1 from its tag therefore
  produced different code than installing 5.5.1 from npm. `auth/` is in that list now.
* The code is otherwise identical to 5.5.1: the same bounded, jittered backoff on the background
  token refresh. Nothing to change when upgrading; 5.5.2 exists so the tag and the artifact agree.

*****************

## Release ONDEWO CSI Typescript Client 5.5.1

### Bug Fixes

* A failed background token refresh no longer ends token renewal for the life of the process.
  `scheduleRefresh` ran only on the success path, so a single transient Keycloak failure left no timer
  armed: the access token then lapsed and every later call failed `UNAUTHENTICATED` until the
  application logged in again. The stale token keeps working until it expires, which is what made the
  defect silent.
* The failure path now re-arms with bounded exponential backoff and full jitter -- 5 s doubling to a
  300 s ceiling, with the actual wait drawn uniformly from `[base, ceiling]` -- rather than at the 1 s
  scheduling floor. The jitter is load-bearing at ondewo's fan-out: one client per call container means
  N clients whose refreshes fail in the same instant would otherwise retry in lockstep against a realm
  they all share.
* A successful refresh resets the backoff ladder, and the bounded-deadline and `stop()` guards still
  apply to every re-arm.
* An `onRefreshError` handler that throws no longer kills the refresh loop, and its error no longer
  escapes the timer callback as a process-fatal `unhandledRejection`.

## Release ONDEWO CSI Typescript Client 5.5.0

### Improvements

* Built against [ondewo-csi-api 5.5.0](https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-csi-api/releases/tag/5.5.0), which tracks ondewo-nlu-api 7.1.0 (was 7.0.0) and ondewo-s2t-api 7.5.0 (was 7.4.0).
* `ondewo/csi/conversation.proto` is unchanged in that API release, so the CSI service surface is identical and this client stays wire-compatible with its predecessor. What grows is the vendored surface it re-exports: `speech-to-text.proto` gains the `VadMethod` and `TsdMethod` enums and the `Silero` and `WespeakerTsd` messages (voice-activity and turn-shift detection configuration), and `rag.proto` gains `RagCrawlerIncrementalConfig`.

## Release ONDEWO CSI Typescript Client 5.4.1

### Bug Fixes

* [[OND221-2830]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND221-2830) Regenerated with [ondewo-proto-compiler 5.13.0](https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-proto-compiler/releases/tag/5.13.0).
* [[OND221-2830]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND221-2830) The hand-written `auth/` surface is now re-exported from the generated public-api barrel. It was compiled and shipped inside the package but nothing re-exported it, so importing a symbol from the package root did not resolve and consumers could only deep-import the module. The re-export is emitted by the compiler, so it survives the regeneration that rewrites the barrel on every build.
* [[OND221-2830]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND221-2830) Tooling: `conventional-pre-commit` now runs before `giticket` at the commit-msg stage - with giticket first, its `[OND221-2830] fix: ...` rewrite was no longer valid Conventional Commits and every commit on a ticket branch failed. `README.md` is prettier-ignored where `.prettierrc` sets `useTabs` and markdownlint's MD010 de-tabs the same blocks, and the codegen `docker run` invocations no longer pass `-it`, which fails outside a TTY.
